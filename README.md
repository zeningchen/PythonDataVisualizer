# PythonDataVisualizer
The visualizer enables very easy and configurable data visualization on row/column-indexable datasets such as CSV or .db files, through a pyqt5 gui. The plotter allows plotting and comparing multiple datasets, or multiple instances of the same dataset. The interface is lightweight and easy to use.
